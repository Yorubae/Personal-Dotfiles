# Personal Dotfile Repository

This is a repository for my personal dotfiles. It contains configuration files for various applications and tools that I use on a daily basis.
Also ,Im going to add a shell script that will automatically replace your configs with mine

# What am i using?

* wm/compositor  : ```hyprland```  
* bar : ```waybar```  
* text-editor : ```Nvim```  
* session-locker : ```swaylock```  
* prompt : ```starship```  
* terminal : ```alacritty```  
* music visualizer : ```cava```  
* shell : ```fish```  
* file manager : ```thunar```  
* launcher/power menu : ```rofi```  

btw for laucher and powermenu im using this [rofi forked!](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)!
